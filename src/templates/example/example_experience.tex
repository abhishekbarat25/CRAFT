% BULLET WRITING TIPS:

% Strong action verbs: Led, Developed, Implemented, Designed, Optimized,
% Built, Created, Reduced, Increased, Managed, Delivered, Automated
%
% Quantify results:
% - "Reduced costs by 25%" instead of "Reduced costs"
% - "Led team of 5 engineers" instead of "Led a team"
% - "Processed 1M+ records daily" instead of "Processed large datasets"
%
% Match company needs:
% - Innovation-focused: emphasize new technologies, research, patents
% - Enterprise: emphasize scale, reliability, compliance
% - Startup: emphasize speed, versatility, impact
