% WORK EXPERIENCE - Company-Specific Experience Section
% =============================================================================
% PURPOSE:
%   This file contains your work experience, tailored to emphasize aspects
%   most relevant to the target company.
%
% INSTRUCTIONS:
%   1. List experiences in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
%   2. Use the \experienceItem command for each position
%   3. Tailor bullet points to highlight relevant achievements
%   4. Use action verbs (Developed, Led, Optimized, Designed, etc.)
%   5. Include quantifiable metrics when possible (%, $, time saved, users)
%   6. Adjust spacing with \vspace to fit resume to one page
%
% COMMAND FORMAT:
%   \experienceItem{Job Title}{Company, Location}{Start Date -- End Date}
%
% SPACING TIPS:
%   - Use \vspace{-8pt} between bullets to tighten spacing
%   - Use \vspace{-10pt} or \vspace{-12pt} after \experienceItem for tighter fit
%   - Adjust values to control whitespace and fit to one page
%
% TAILORING STRATEGY:
%   - For different companies, reorder or emphasize different bullet points
%   - Use company-relevant keywords (their tech stack, methodologies)
%   - Highlight projects similar to what the target company does
%   - De-emphasize or remove less relevant experience
